\( N, K \) and
\( a_1, a_2, \dots  , a_{n} \)
which \( a_i \) mean the building of \( ith \) building
and have two operator

1. divide all of the building to 2, \( \lfloor \frac{a_i}{2} \rfloor \)
2. minus specific building height of \( K \)
what is the minimal operation to let the \( N \) building Height \( \leq 0 \)
\( 0 \leq a_i, K \leq 10^{9} \)

*Answer*
we know that it is always optimal to first use the \( 1 \) operation(\( /2 \)), and than use \( -K \) option
and the maximal time of the \( 1 \) operation is at most \( \log _2 (N) \) time
so the time complexity is \( O(N \log _2 N) \)
